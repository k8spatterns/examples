== Batch Job

Let's create a batch job for generating thousands of random numbers.
Our typical REST example at https://github.com/k8spatterns/random-generator[random-generator] also contains a plain Java class `RandomRunner`, which is suitable for batch processing.

This example assumes a Kubernetes installation available.
In this case, it's best played with Minikube as we need some support for PVs.
Check the link:../../INSTALL.adoc#minikube[INSTALL] documentation for how to install Minikube.

To access the PersistentVolume used in this demo, let's mount a local directory into the Minikube VM that we later then use for a PersistentVolume that is mounted into the Pod:

[source, bash]
----
minikube start --mount --mount-string="$(pwd)/logs:/example"
----

Alternatively, you can mount the directory on the fly in the background.

[source,bash]
---
minikube mount $(pwd)/logs:/example
----

This command makes this directory available within the Minikube VM at the path `/example`.

Let's now create the PersistentVolume along with a PVC which can be mounted into our Job later:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://k8spatterns.io/BatchJob/pv-and-pvc.yml
----

The Job can be started with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://k8spatterns.io/BatchJob/job.yml
----

This Job will create multiple Pods to create the number.
Each Pod will run for creating 10000 entries into `logs/random.log`.
The Job is configured to run the Pod 5 times, with three max running in parallel.
That will take some minutes, but in the end, you should have 50000 entries in the log file.

You can check the Job's status with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get jobs
NAME                     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
random-generator-lnx4v   3/5           100s       100s
----

Also, you can check with `kubetl get pods` that only 3 Pods will run simultaneously.

If you want to run the Job a second time, call `kubectl create -f job.yml` again.
The Job's name is auto-generated, so there won't be any name clash.

Now let's try out how an _Indexed Job_ work.
With `indexed-job.yml`, we split the file `logs/random.log` into five files with five concurrent Pods.
Each Pod will create one file by selecting a different range from the original file.
Please see the comments within `indexed-job.yml` for more details.

To run this split Job, run:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://k8spatterns.io/BatchJob/indexed-job.yml
----

When the Job is finished, you will find files `logs/random-0.txt`, ..., `logs/random-4.txt` with the parts out of `logs/random.log`.

Finally, you can delete all jobs with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete jobs --label app=random-generator
----
