== Periodic Job

Our Cron Job example builds on top of the link:../BatchJob/README.adoc[Batch Job] example above, to the basic setup is the same:

* A Minikube installation available, ideally with link:../../INSTALL.adoc#minikube[Minikube]
* Minikube started with `minikube start --mount --mount-string="$(pwd)/logs:/example"` to mount the local `logs/` into the Minikube VM

Then create the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim with

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f pv-and-pvc.yml
----

but you don't have to do it, if you already have your Minikube still running from the _Batch Job_ example footnote:[If you reuse the Batch Job example, don't forget that the `random.log` is generated in the `logs/` directory over there.]

Now create the CronJob which fires every three minutes:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create -f cron-jobs.yml
----

In this example we only use only one completion per Job (i.e. the default for a Job).

You can check the `logs/random.log` for the numbers generated, and also of course the Pods that are run on behalf of the job.
